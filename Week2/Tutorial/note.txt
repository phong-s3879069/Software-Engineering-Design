In C++, files are mainly dealt by using following three classes available in 
<fstream> header file.
# ofstream: allow you to open (or create) a file as an output stream. ie. WRITE
# Ifstream : allow you to open file as an input stream   ie. READ
# fstream : allow you to open (or create)  a file as
            either an input or output stream.    ie. Both READ/WRITE


Writing to and Reading from a File with C++

1. Writing to a File: we can use stream insertion operator (<<) with 
ofstream or fstream object (instead of cout object for console output).
2. Reading from a File: we can use stream extraction operator (>>) with 
ifstream or fstream object (instead of cin object for console input).
